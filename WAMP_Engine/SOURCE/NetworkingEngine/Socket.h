Because I do not expect to have time to implement more than the reliable udp supersocket for this
assignment, I will just make send in supersocket take an id. I need to find a way to solve this
problem though because pretty much only the reliable udp socket is concerned with keeping track
of the people using it and I really cant bloat the base class with derived specific stuff.

This is sort of a lie. I do not actually maintain a connection quite as
robustly as TCP might. For instance, I don't ever send keep alive packets, I just
assume that you are using this understanding how it actually works, not how it should.
